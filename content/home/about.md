# About me  

Been writing software professionally for 13 years now. Have written a ton of C# code. Was once a Microsoft MVP for C#.
Was a core team member of Atmel Studio. Have written some Go code too, for personal projects. 

Lately hacking on the GNU toolchain - avr-gcc, binutils and avr-libc. Love experimenting with programming languages
- currently digging Clojure and Rust.
